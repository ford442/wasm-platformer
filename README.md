#  WASM-Venture

WASM-Venture is a 2D platformer adventure game that runs entirely in the browser, powered by C++ compiled to WebAssembly.🚀 

Core Concept
The player controls Wazzy, a small, agile dog robot who has crash-landed on an unknown planet. The goal is to navigate a series of levels, collect scattered ship parts, and overcome obstacles to repair the ship and return home.🛠️

Technical Architecture
Core Logic: C++
Compilation Target: WebAssembly (via Emscripten)
Frontend/Bridge: TypeScript
Rendering: HTML Canvas 2D📋
Current Status
Currently in Phase 1: The Foundation. 
We are setting up the initial project structure, C++ to WASM compilation pipeline, and basic player rendering.🏗️
